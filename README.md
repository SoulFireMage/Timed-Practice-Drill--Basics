# TimedTest
A quick solo test: first commit is the code at 45 mins including generating test data internally. Goal, demonstrate a very simple object heirarchy and utilize them according to specs in the shorttest time. Initial commit has no testing and commentary added during the time allowed.

Goals:

* Build the appropriate Xaml by hand in the code editor to display the data and provide the filter buttons/textboxes
* Construct a country/city/people hierarchy in a simple way but use appropriate data structures and property access
* Attempt to build the code such that on first run there were no exceptions and the data displayed as predicted (success)
* Expand with further drills relating to events and LINQ filtering (Commit 2)

No databinding is used in this drill.

Why have drills like this? 

Basically, most of the online challanges focus on solving puzzles of various kinds. However, drills like this are the real equivalent of practicing scales on a piano
Puzzles are the equivalent of practicing pieces of music or even composing new pieces. 

Set drills of this type (I don't use the term kata) are about basic conceptual and syntactical work in a given language; in my case designed to overcome what I call syntax blindness under pressure.
